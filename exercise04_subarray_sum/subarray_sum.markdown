Problem 
---

In computer science, the maximum subarray problem is the task of
finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of 
numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has the 
largest sum. 

Example
---

For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; 
the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.

Exercise
---

Write a method that when given an array, return the biggest subarray and the sum, e.g.

    biggest_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4]) # => [6, [4, −1, 2, 1]]
